### get last n line of a file like tail 

```python
import os


def tail(f, lines=1, _buffer=4098):
    """Tail a file and get X lines from the end"""
    # place holder for the lines found
    lines_found = []
    block_counter = -1

    # loop until we find X lines
    while len(lines_found) < lines:
        try:
            f.seek(block_counter * _buffer, os.SEEK_END)
        except IOError:  # either file is too small, or too many lines requested
            f.seek(0)
            lines_found = f.readlines()
            break

        lines_found = f.readlines()
        # decrement the block counter to get the
        # next X bytes
        block_counter -= 1

    return lines_found[-lines:]
```
